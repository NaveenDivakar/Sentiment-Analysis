The images from the camera are decent too in every lighting condition. I have attached some samples with this review. I'm very satisfied with the phone. I do get around 5-6 hour of SOT which is pretty good for a phone of this size. The screen is bright and vibrant which is expected from a Samsung.

MOBGNPGZVX4PCTTF,Samsung Galaxy S23,4,"Writing brutally honest review I have been using this beast for the last 2 weeks so I have pretty much experienced everything.I wanted a compact phone for work purposes and my usage includes 30+ calls in a day , 8-10 emails , opening 2-3 sheets as and when required.

MOBGNPGZVX4PCTTF,Samsung Galaxy S23,5,I absolutely loved the phone. It feels so premium and compact to hold it. The camera is just phenomenal. Brightness is the best in class. Absolute deal breaker!!
MOBGNPGZVX4PCTTF,Samsung Galaxy S23,5,"One thing is clear to me that almost everyone who has put negative reviews on battery life of this phone is stupid...... people with no damn knowledge of how hardware works..... keeping refresh rate at 120hz will obviously drain the battery of any phone faster, even if it has 20000mah battery..... bring the refresh rate down to standard and see the magic happen.... I charge my S23 beast only once in 24hrs ..... nothing comes close to the performance of this beauty..... wrote this after 2 mont..."
MOBGNPGZVX4PCTTF,Samsung Galaxy S23,4,"EDIT: Review after 17 months usageThere are hundreds of reviews for this device so let me get straight to the pros and cons as a normal user.Cons:1. Battery life is not as great as many reviewers say, I'm not a heavy user but if I'm traveling and using phone data the device doesn't even last a day. A hard reset did help improving the battery performance but still it hardly lasts a day. 2. Samsung is providing 45W charging speed for the Plus and Ultra models but only 25W for S23, this is d..."

MOBGNPGZVX4PCTTF,Samsung Galaxy S23,5,I switched my phone after 3.5 yrs and it's really a good phone. Good battery life for an average user like me. Display and design both are awesome.

MOBGNPGZVX4PCTTF,Samsung Galaxy S23,5,"After jumping from pixel 4a and edge 30 to Samsung s23, color is fab, performance and battery are very good and improved compared to previous S series. Camera and mainly video quality beats apple."
MOBGNPGZVX4PCTTF,Samsung Galaxy S23,5,"I upgraded to this from Redmi Note 4, so it is a very significant upgrade for me. Phone is fast, super responsive with no lag at all which is what you expect from a Snapdragon 8 gen 2 for Galaxy. I got 256 GB variant, so I have UFS 4.0 storage. Best camera and display, design wise looks awesome with thin and even bezels.

MOBGNPGZVX4PCTTF,Samsung Galaxy S23,5,Samsung trusted company üëå
MOBGNPGZVX4PCTTF,Samsung Galaxy S23,4,"After almost 15 days of usage, Samsung S23 has lived up to my expectations. The obvious pros are its compact form factor and splendid display. During the initial few days of usage, the phone does get warm along the metal frame while multitasking or using heavy apps, but that has settled down now with continuous optimization. It still gets slightly warm but nothing too alarming.One suggestion for those users who take a lot of pictures or videos is that the 128 GB may seem to be a little short..."

MOBGNPGZVX4PCTTF,Samsung Galaxy S23,5,Overall very good phone.if you use your mobile extensively then battery MAY disappoint you. For me battery is enough to survive whole day.Camera is good. it will take pictures close to reality. if you are relame/poco/oppo and other Chinese phone user and planning to switch to samsung then be mindful that camera selfi will take your real photo and will not apply lipstick and makeup and you may end up hating you own face.In performance department as well it is excellent.while charging ph...

MOBGNPGZVX4PCTTF,Samsung Galaxy S23,5,Writing this review after using for 6 monthsPros:Camera quality is impressive especially Portait mode.. The quality of images are similar to DSLR camera. Phone is smooth and it works like a magic.Cons:As this is compact phone.. typing something needs more care.. lot of typi mistakes by using tge small keyboard.Fingerprint doesn't work sometimes.Had to to try multiple times.Battery drains faster..always need to carry backup or charger with you.
MOBGNPGZVX4PCTTF,Samsung Galaxy S23,5,"The phone is awesome,I got this by 52k.But it is worth the price.Display is awesome Indisplay finger print is very much responsiveBattery backup is ok for one day useCamera performance is top notch Portrait mode is like Dslr cameras Night mode is also goodVideography is goodGood refresh rateOne hand phoneOnly drawbacks are no charger inside the box we have to purchase separately Charging speed is more than 1 hour to full charge."

MOBGNPGZVX4PCTTF,Samsung Galaxy S23,5,Battery could be better. But this is ultimately CHOTA DON. Far far better choice against iPhone. Fully powerpack and all in one. Superb phone but noticed some overheating issues..

MOBGT5F2WD8HPTPZ,Google Pixel 8,5,"I have been using the Pixel 8 for 2 months. Here is my experience so far. I'll divide the review in Pros and cons.Pro:1. Camera: So far this is the proper point and shoot camera. Just open the camera, click pictures and they will turn out to be great. Compared to Samsung's, iphone people prefer pictures by pixel, be it any situation.2. UI: There's a following for pixel users that blindly opt for it. I'll have to say they are right about it. It was a great experience using it any day. If yo..."

MOBGT5F2WD8HPTPZ,Google Pixel 8,4,Probably the best android phone in terms of user expirience.Lots of things to learn.camera captures real photos.Only issue is phone heating on the side aluminium panel which is really annoying considering its winter in india.I will post another review in a month after heavy gaming.

MOBGT5F2WD8HPTPZ,Google Pixel 8,4,"Initial impressions (its been about three days since I got the phone)The phone looks and feels GREAT. Better in real life than in pictures (even the official pictures put up by Google). Definitely an eye-turner in a market full of samsungs and apples. The camera lives up to the hype.

MOBGT5F2WD8HPTPZ,Google Pixel 8,5,"An absolute banger of a product by Google. I chose this over the iPhone 15 and S24 and my oh my I was right. There's no way I'm going back to a mid range or cheap phone like the Oppos or Redmi again. Not like I'll have to ever, the longevity of Google is enough to keep me with them for many years.I have loved the experience of the product so far and I am glad I bought the Pixel 8. However, there are still some points to note. The camera doesn't have a Pro mode or High Res mode, although the..."

MOBGT5F2WD8HPTPZ,Google Pixel 8,5,"Didn't see any heating issues which was a concern and I can see it's a niche product, not for everyone but hopefully pixels will become more mainstream."
MOBGT5F2WD8HPTPZ,Google Pixel 8,5,It's too early for review but this is based on first few days experience. 7 years of OS and security updates was pleasant and unexpected. I was a fan since Nexus  series but now with the Pixel series specifically Pixel 8 they did a major upgrade complementing with AI and photography. Google has always been champ of OS and now they are excelling Hardware also combining AI and Photography. Cheers.

MOBGT5F2WD8HPTPZ,Google Pixel 8,5,Just perfect no nonsense phone. Camera is top notch. Those who've experienced it will know. I have an S23 Ultra as well but the picture quality looks a tad better than the samsung flagship. Yes the Samsung has the resolution but the picture quality and shadows are much much better in pixel. UI needs no introduction. Go for it.
MOBGT5F2WD8HPTPZ,Google Pixel 8,5,Really love it
MOBGT5F2WD8HPTPZ,Google Pixel 8,5,Initially when I received the phone I was disappointed.

MOBGT5F2WD8HPTPZ,Google Pixel 8,5,I will say if u don't play games and not a very heavy addictive user of phone then u can go blindly for it. The camera never disappoints you the screen makes you fall in love and it's haptic feedback and vibration motor... I will just say I love it ... U may find a lot of negative feedback and comments about the phone but it's not the way as they show it's far better and at the price in BBD sale it will be an insane buy to get it.

Excellent performance. Fast , sharp colours.4. Sharp snaps even in low light.5. Battery capacity is low, had to charge in between, may not go for full day even for moderate use."
MOBHFHDRVUDB3HFX,Motorola Edge 50,5,"Every segment is as promised. Everybody had doubts on battery.  I charged 20 min. It went from 30% to 72%. Drops 3% from 70% to 30% when left idle for 7 hours.  So, you can buy it without any doubts on battery."
MOBHFHDRVUDB3HFX,Motorola Edge 50,4,Yes phone is definitely recommended but only for those who desire a small compact device. Good work by Motorola. The screen is good camera portrait shots are also amazing. performance is also good in daily uses. Not recommended for gamers. Only 1 compromise with the battery you have but you have 68wt fast charging. Overall i like it because i require a small compact device with a good camera.
MOBHFHDRVUDB3HFX,Motorola Edge 50,4,"Opinion after using for 16 days:Great phone at this price, only issue is overheating and slight low battery.Pros - Everything else is great, except:Cons- 1. Overheating - Phone heats up during charging. It heats up even more than this, when sharing mobile hotspot alone(greater than 10 minutes). Wouldn't recommend mixing these two together.This may be a concern especially during summers.2. Battery - Battery is a bit less. 5000mAh would've been better. On light usage (2-3 hrs screen ti..."

MOBHFHDRVUDB3HFX,Motorola Edge 50,5,Super product. I like the phone very much.
MOBHFHDRVUDB3HFX,Motorola Edge 50,4,"All things are good The Moto Edge 50 Neo is an impressive phone overall with great performance, design, and features. However, I do have some concerns with the camera. I have noticed that the front camera tends to show a yellow tint on skin tones, and the 3x telephoto lens also exhibits some color issues it gets yellow tint in most of the photos. I'm hopeful that these issues will be addressed in a future software update from the company. Other than that, the phone delivers a solid experience."
MOBHFHDRVUDB3HFX,Motorola Edge 50,4,If your requirement is just compact phone with decent specifications go for it
MOBHFHDRVUDB3HFX,Motorola Edge 50,4,"The camera is good üëç, handy to hold the phone."
MOBHFHDRVUDB3HFX,Motorola Edge 50,4,Everything is exceptional at this price range. Motorola just needs to provide camera update to improve Indian skin tone. Camera is also excellent except human skin tone

MOBHFHDRVUDB3HFX,Motorola Edge 50,4,"The phone tends to heat up in daily usage, a typical characteristic of a mediatek processor phone.A hard case is included in the box, a soft case would have been a better option.Display looks crisp.Camera is decent. Performance while taking photos could have been improved from software perspective.Migrated from an old phone to this one. All apps got installed, some got missed. Now installing those and logging in into all the apps."

MOBHFHDRVUDB3HFX,Motorola Edge 50,4,"Wireless charging of 15 watt doesn't make any sense as phone supports 68 watt wired ,Moto should remove wireless charging and use that cost and space to increase battery that way this phone will surpass every other flat display phone in this segment. Moreover they should add plastic or if feasible then a glass back variant."

MOBHFHDRVUDB3HFX,Motorola Edge 50,4,It's fantastic for me. But I will say if you are purchasing then go with the colour red it is better then the latte. And battery for a 4310 mah comparison. It works awesome. Once I charged it at 7:30 and phn was at 24 % at 8:03 am it was charged 100%. And at 9 pm battery was 27 % with 10 + hours of screen on time with medium uses. Battery will work fantastically if u avoid gaming.

MOBHFHDRVUDB3HFX,Motorola Edge 50,4,You can rely on it for almost everything. I'm worried about to call it an all-rounder smartphone just because of the slightly poor performance and battery life. If you're not a screenworm then this will surely survive one day with one charge. The camera is good and photogenic. The only problem with the camera is its laggy camera ui and the reddish tone on face.
